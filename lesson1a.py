# Above we printed numbers and strings
# Data types- the type of data you are using...numeric,sequence type, boolean,set,dictionary
#NUMERIC:
# Integer- is a whole number  - to +
# Float It's a number with decimals - to +
# Complex- a number with two parts

# Variables- they store values/data,,containers of values
weight = 80 #int
height = 1.5 #float
age = 20 #int
# Above- age, weight,height are variable names
# Developers come up with names to use
# As you come up with the variables names, consider the following rules:
#1. Do not start with numbers
#2. Do not space
#3.If you need to space, use underscore(_) and not any other symbol
#4.` Use meaningful names i.e max is better than m
# 5. When variable name is in CAPS, means constant
#6. Variables are case sensitive: MAX and max are different
